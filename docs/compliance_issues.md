# CloudCRM Infrastructure Compliance Issues

This document outlines the deliberate compliance issues in the CloudCRM infrastructure and explains their implications for GDPR compliance and ANSSI security recommendations.

## GDPR Compliance Issues

### Article 5: Principles relating to processing of personal data

| Issue | Location | Description | Compliance Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| No data minimization | RDS database structure | Database stores excessive customer data without need | Violates Article 5(1)(c) requiring data minimization |
| No storage limitation | RDS database | No automatic data retention/deletion policy | Violates Article 5(1)(e) requiring storage limitation |
| Plaintext PII in logs | `logs/cloudcrm_activity.log` | Customer emails, names, and addresses in plaintext | Violates Article 5(1)(f) requiring appropriate security |

### Article 6 & 7: Lawfulness of processing & Conditions for consent

| Issue | Location | Description | Compliance Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| No consent tracking | Web application | Creating users without consent verification | Violates Article 7(1) requiring demonstrable consent |
| Tracking without consent | Webapp module | Google Analytics without consent banner | Violates Article 7(1) requiring clear affirmative consent |
| No consent withdrawal | Web application | No mechanism to withdraw consent | Violates Article 7(3) requiring easy consent withdrawal |

### Article 32: Security of processing

| Issue | Location | Description | Compliance Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Unencrypted database | RDS module | `storage_encrypted = false` | Violates Article 32(1)(a) requiring encryption |
| Public database access | RDS module | `publicly_accessible = true` | Violates Article 32(1)(b) on confidentiality |
| HTTP instead of HTTPS | Webapp module | `viewer_protocol_policy = "allow-all"` | Violates Article 32(1)(a) requiring secure transmission |
| Weak credentials | Multiple locations | Hardcoded weak passwords | Violates Article 32(1)(b) on access control |
| Excessive permissions | EC2 module | Administrator access for instance | Violates Article 32(1)(b) on least privilege |

## ANSSI Security Recommendations Violations

### Network Security

| Issue | Location | Description | Security Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Overly permissive security groups | VPC module | `0.0.0.0/0` in security groups | Exposes services to the entire internet |
| Missing private subnets | VPC module | Only public subnets defined | Exposes backend services unnecessarily |
| No network segmentation | VPC module | All resources in same security group | Violates defense-in-depth principle |
| No VPC flow logs | VPC module | No traffic monitoring | Reduces ability to detect intrusions |

### Access Management

| Issue | Location | Description | Security Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Weak passwords | EC2 user data, RDS | `Password123!` | Susceptible to brute force attacks |
| Hardcoded credentials | EC2 user data | Credentials in user data script | Exposed in AWS console and logs |
| Excessive IAM permissions | EC2 module | `AdministratorAccess` policy | Violates principle of least privilege |
| No MFA requirement | IAM configuration | Missing MFA enforcement | Reduces account security |

### Data Protection

| Issue | Location | Description | Security Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Unencrypted EBS volumes | EC2 module | `encrypted = false` | Data exposed if volumes compromised |
| Unencrypted RDS | RDS module | `storage_encrypted = false` | Database content exposed if breached |
| Public S3 bucket | Webapp module | Public read access | Potentially exposes sensitive data |
| No S3 versioning | Webapp module | No object versioning | No protection against accidental deletion |

### Application Security

| Issue | Location | Description | Security Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Outdated software | EC2 user data | No automatic updates | Vulnerable to known exploits |
| SQL injection vulnerability | Application logs | String concatenation in queries | Database compromise risk |
| Missing WAF | Webapp module | No AWS WAF integration | Vulnerable to OWASP Top 10 attacks |
| Insecure HTTP | Webapp module | No HTTPS enforcement | Data transmission easily intercepted |

### Monitoring and Incident Response

| Issue | Location | Description | Security Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Sensitive data in logs | Application logs | PII and credentials in logs | Expands potential breach impact |
| No CloudTrail | Main Terraform | No audit logging | Cannot track administrative actions |
| No CloudWatch alerts | Main Terraform | No monitoring alerts | Delayed incident detection |
| No automated response | EC2 user data | No remediation for brute force | Attackers have multiple attempts |

## Remediation Priorities

ComplianceAI should identify and suggest the following remediation priorities:

1. **Critical**:
   - Enable encryption for RDS and EBS volumes
   - Restrict security group access to specific IPs
   - Implement HTTPS for all web traffic
   - Remove hardcoded credentials

2. **High**:
   - Create private subnets for backend services
   - Implement proper IAM roles with least privilege
   - Add consent tracking mechanism
   - Set up CloudTrail and CloudWatch monitoring

3. **Medium**:
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Add S3 bucket versioning
   - Configure CloudWatch alerts
   - Mask sensitive data in logs

4. **Low**:
   - Add geo-restrictions to CloudFront
   - Improve documentation
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Add tags for better resource management

## Expected Compliance Score

Based on these issues, the expected compliance score would be:

- GDPR Compliance: 30/100
- ANSSI Security: 25/100
- Overall Compliance: 28/100

This score is deliberately low to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ComplianceAI Agent in detecting and suggesting remediation for compliance issues.
